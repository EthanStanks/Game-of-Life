<h1>Conway's Game of Life</h1>
<br>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton created by John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a simulation of life and death of cells on a two-dimensional grid. This program is a Windows C# application that renders Conway's Game of Life with additional features listed below.

<h3>Basic Features</h3>
<ol>
<li>Render Conway's Game of Life in a .NET application.</li>
<li>Cells can be turned on and off by clicking on them with the mouse.</li>
<li>Living cells with less than 2 living neighbors die in the next generation.</li>
<li>Living cells with more than 3 living neighbors die in the next generation.</li>
<li>Living cells with 2 or 3 living neighbors live in the next generation.</li>
<li>Dead cells with exactly 3 living neighbors live in the next generation.</li>
<li>Start, Pause and Next menu items and tool strip buttons.</li>
<li>Randomizing the universe.</li>
<li>Emptying the universe.</li>
<li>Saving the current universe to a text file.</li>
<li>Opening a previously saved universe.</li>
<li>Show the current generation.</li>
<li>Show the current number of living cells.</li>
<li>Controlling how many milliseconds between new generations.</li>
<li>Controlling the current size of the universe.</li>
<li>Displaying the neighbor count in each cell.</li>
<li>Implement a View Menu that toggles the grid on and off, toggles the neighbor count display.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Advanced Features</h3>
<ol>
<li>Game Colors.</li>
<li>Universe boundary behavior.</li>
<li>Context sensitive menu.</li>
<li>Heads up display.</li>
<li>Settings.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<ul>
<li>Clone or download the project from the repository.</li>
<li>pen the project in Visual Studio.</li>
<li>Build and run the project.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<ul>
<li>Click on the cells in the grid to turn them on or off.</li>
<li>Click on the Start button to begin the simulation.</li>
<li>Click on the Pause button to pause the simulation.</li>
<li>Click on the Next button to advance the simulation by one generation.</li>
<li>Click on the Randomize button to randomly populate the grid.</li>
<li>Click on the Clear button to empty the grid.</li>
<li>Click on the Save button to save the current grid to a text file.</li>
<li>Click on the Open button to load a previously saved grid from a text file.</li>
<li>Use the Size button to adjust the size of the grid.</li>
<li>Use the Speed button to adjust the speed of the simulation.</li>
<li>Use the View menu to toggle the grid, neighbor count display and heads up display.</li>
</ul>
